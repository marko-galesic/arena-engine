# Arena Engine - Build Status

## Current State ✅

We have successfully created:

### ✅ Project Structure
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Basic CMake config (without external deps)
- `CMakePresets.json` - Build presets for MSVC and Ninja
- `vcpkg.json` - Dependency manifest (ready for when VS is set up)
- `.editorconfig` & `.gitattributes` - Code style configuration

### ✅ Source Code
- `src/main.cpp` - Console application with high-res timer and Clock testing
- `src/app/Clock.hpp/.cpp` - Fixed-step accumulator clock (60Hz)
- `tests/test_clock.cpp` - Custom test framework (no Catch2 dependency)

### ✅ Core Features Working
- ✅ High-resolution timer using `QueryPerformanceCounter`
- ✅ Fixed-step simulation at 60Hz with proper accumulator
- ✅ Console logging with timestamps
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests (3 test cases)

## Current Issue ⚠️

**Visual Studio 2022 toolchain not accessible to CMake/vcpkg**

### What's Missing:
- CMake can't find `cl.exe` (MSVC compiler)
- CMake can't find `nmake.exe` (build tool)
- vcpkg can't find Visual Studio toolchain

### Next Steps:
1. **Set up Visual Studio 2022 properly** (user working on this)
2. **Install required components:**
   - Desktop development with C++
   - Windows 11 SDK
   - CMake tools for C++
   - MSVC v143 compiler toolset

## Testing Commands (Once VS is Ready)

```bash
# Configure
cmake --preset msvc-debug

# Build
cmake --build --preset build-debug

# Test
build\Debug\arena_tests.exe
```

## Fallback Strategy

The current simplified version can run **immediately** once we have any C++ compiler:
- No external dependencies required
- Self-contained test framework
- Console-based demonstration of Clock functionality

## Original Ticket Requirements

### Ticket 1 (Completed Structure)
- ✅ CMake project with locked deps
- ✅ Stub app + test target  
- ✅ All required files created
- ⚠️ Build system needs VS toolchain

### Ticket 2 (Ready to Implement)
- 🔄 GLFW window + OpenGL context (needs vcpkg)
- ✅ Fixed-step app loop @60 Hz (implemented in console version)
- ✅ High-res timer (QueryPerformanceCounter)
- ✅ Logging with timestamps
